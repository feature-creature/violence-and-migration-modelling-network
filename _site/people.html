<strong>Ligia Kiss</strong><br />
Principal Investigator<br />
Senior Lecturer</p>

<p><strong>Ligia Kiss</strong> is social epidemiologist with expertise in violence, human trafficking and health. Her technical expertise is mainly in complex research designs and especially in the evaluation of complex interventions, and the use of mixed methods in research. Ligia’s current work focusses on methodological innovations for applied research, and on intervention development and evaluation for prevention of labour exploitation and youth violence. In the past twenty years, Ligia has led, designed and implemented numerous research projects in Africa, Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Europe.</p>

<strong>Alys McAlpine</strong><br />
Senior Research Fellow in Migration, Violence, and Complexity</p>

<p><strong>Alys McAlpine</strong> is a computational social scientist with expertise in migration, human trafficking, labour exploitation, and conflict-related violence. She has recently completed her PhD at the Gender, Violence and Health Centre (GVHC) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). Her thesis applied social network methods and agent-based modelling to explore migration networks and labour recruitment in the Myanmar-Thailand migration corridor. Alys’ current work focusses on developing and applying computational social science methods for research and intervention development to prevent violence and exploitation. Before her thesis, Alys was a Research Fellow at the GVHC and worked on an evaluation of a GBV case-management intervention in Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, among other research projects.</p>

<br />
<strong>David Osrin</strong>, FRCPCH, is a professor of Global Health at University College London and a Wellcome Senior Research Fellow in clinical science. Based in Mumbai since 2004 in a research partnership with SNEHA, his main interest is in community action to improve the health of women and children in informal settlements. He has worked on participatory community-based interventions to improve maternal and newborn survival, childhood nutrition and immunization, and family planning. His current focus is on the prevention of violence against women and girls, particularly in the urban context.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/cathy_zimmerman.jpeg" alt="Cathy Zimmerman" class="bio" /><br />
<br />
<strong>Cathy Zimmerman</strong> is a behavioural and social scientist. She is a founding staff member of the Gender Violence &amp; Health Centre at LSHTM where she is a Professor in Migration, Violence, and Health. Cathy’s research focusses on human trafficking, exploitation and gender-based violence. Cathy and her team have produced policy and service-focused evidence from multiple corners of the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom and multiple European countries. Cathy’s current work focuses on child domestic workers under the MILLBY Research Programme on violence against women and girls in Southeast Asia. Cathy and colleagues recently completed a five-year intervention evaluation, the DFID-funded Study on Work in Freedom Transnational (SWIFT) Evaluation of the International Labour Organization’s “Work in Freedom” programme in South Asia. Cathy also worked in Cambodia from 1993 to 1998 where she established the first local non-governmental organization against domestic violence against women and children.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/thomas_evans.jpeg" alt="Thomas Evans" class="bio" /><br />
<br />
<strong>Thomas Evans</strong> is a Lecturer in Quantitative Methods at The Bartlett’s Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. His current research aims involve the application of game theoretic models to security scenarios with a spatial dimension and of multi-objective optimisation techniques (based on linear and non-linear programming) to problems of land use planning. In spatial contexts, such deterministic optimisation methods can often be naturally combined with simulation-based agent-based modelling approaches to create rich and versatile models of real-world systems, capable of representing complex realities that pure mathematical tools could not tackle effectively in isolation. His research goals are, therefore, to develop new theoretical mathematical tools, building on existing optimisation techniques; to collaborate with experts in other disciplines to apply these tools in new contexts; and to advance the role of agent-based modelling as a companion to spatial optimisation models, to represent complex real-world systems.</p>
