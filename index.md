The Violence and Migration Modelling (VaMM) Network is an interdisciplinary group of researchers who are collaborating to develop new methods at the intersection of public health, complexity science, and data visualisation. The network includes experts in a range of disciplines and domains, including for example, violence and health, migration, intervention design and evaluation, agent-based modelling, Bayesian networks, graphic communication design, and simulation visualisations. 

This interdisciplinary and cross-institutional network was launched in 2021 as part of an ESRC-funded methods development project entitled: [Complex systems simulations for intervention development: Human trafficking and conflict-related violence](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FV006681%2F1).
